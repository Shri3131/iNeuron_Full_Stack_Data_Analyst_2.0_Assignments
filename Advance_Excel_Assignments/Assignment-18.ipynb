    "- In programming language, comments are lines of text that are added to code files to explain what the code does, how it works, or any other relevant information about the code. Comments are not executed by the computer, and they are ignored when the code is run or compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of commenting in code lies in its ability to improve the readability, maintainability, and overall quality of code. Here are some benefits of commenting code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clarity: Comments make code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other programmers who may work with the code in the future. By providing explanations for the code's purpose and how it works, comments can help prevent confusion and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Documentation: Comments can serve as documentation for the code, providing important information such as function and parameter descriptions, usage instructions, and version history.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging: Comments can help with debugging by providing insights into how the code works and what it's supposed to do. This can help identify bugs and other issues more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaboration: Comments can facilitate collaboration among developers working on the same codebase by providing context and explanations for code changes."

By defining a procedure once and then calling it with different arguments as needed, you can make your code more efficient and easier to maintain"

    "In VBA, you don't need to explicitly compile your code as it is compiled automatically when you run or execute it.

This will check your code for syntax errors and other issues, and provide feedback on any errors or warnings it finds.\n",

    "* Syntax errors: Syntax errors are errors in the structure or grammar of your code. These can prevent your code from running or executing correctly, and can be difficult to detect without proper compilation.\n",

    "* Performance issues: Poorly written code can result in slow execution times or excessive memory usage. This can be particularly problematic in large or complex VBA projects.\n",

However, you can also create your own hotkeys to perform custom actions or execute custom macros.\n",
